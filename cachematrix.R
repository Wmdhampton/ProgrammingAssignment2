## Below are two functions that are used to 
## create a special object that stores a matrix
## and cache's its inverse.


##Creates a special "vector", which is
##really a list containing a function to
##set the value of the matrix
##get the value of the matrix
##set the value of the inverse of the matrix
##get the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setInverse <- function(Inverse) m <<- Inverse
  getInverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setInverse = setInverse,
       getInverse = getInverse)

}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the 
## special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has 
## already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse 
## from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, 
## it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the 
## value of the matrix in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setInverse(m)
  m
}
